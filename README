**Perl scripts written for Bioinformatics**

3bases.pl
# to split nucleotides as codons sets of 3 nucleotides
ATGCTAGCATGCATCG -> ATG CTA GCA TGC ATC G

DNA_tools.pl 
# Given a string of DNA sequence
# 1) check whether given sequence is a DNA
# 2) count the nucleotide frequency
# 3) Calculate GC & AT content

ORF_translate.pl
# find reading frames and ORF of given DNA
# count the number of codons and check if the codons are complete
# if complete translate

remove_columns_from_clustal.pl
remove columns from a CLUSTAL alignment. Given an alignment and a file with positions to be removed,the script removes the positions from the alignment

reverse_comp.pl
print the reverse complement of a given DNA sequence

transcription.pl
print the transcribed RNA sequence of a given DNA sequence

Perl package rashmi.pm
# Sub-routines in the package
# 1) mysql_connect - connect to a host
# 2) hyphy_basepath - get basepath of HYPHY installed on the host
# 3) single_breakpoint - get variables to be passed to Hyphy-SBP, check if SBP reports recombination and return results
# 4) run_gard - get variables to be passed to Hyphy-Gard, and return results
# 5) run_gard_processor - run GARDProcessor and return results
# 6) parse_gard - Parse GARD & GARD processor results for breakpoints and pvalues
# 7) fragement - get sequence and breakpoints from GARD and fragment the alignment at the breakpoints
# 8) run_NielsenYang - run NielsenYang.bf for site and branch analysis (Model 1a and 2 of PAML)
# 9) parse_Nielsenyang - parse output from NielsenYang.bf for lnL, dN/dS and Nparams for each model
#10) run_YangNielsen_bs - run YangNielsenBranchSite2005.bf for branch site analysis 
#11) parse_YangNielsen_bs - parse output from YangNielsenBranchSite2005.bf for kappa, lnL, omega and pvalues
#12) run_phyml - given sequences, convert from fasta to phylip format, run phyml, parse phyml results for tree and tree parameters
#13) rm_bootstrap - remove bootstrap values from phyml tree as hyphy segfaults if it is present
#14) full_tree_text - to get a tree string without bootstrap values 
#15) tree_text_wo_bootstrap - print out tree text from tree data hash
#16) tree2num - given a tree, find the numbers assigned to its leaves and nodes by hyphy, return the number list
#17) fast2nex_bayes - given a fasta, output interleaved nex format compatible with Mr Bayes software
#18) rm_duplicates - given an alignment, remove duplicates and return unique set
#19) rm_gap_duplicates - given an alignment, remove duplicates including ones with gaps, return unique set
